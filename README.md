# INFER

**INFER** is a public, AI-assisted crypto asset encyclopedia designed to help anyone research tokens, smart contracts, and on-chain metadata in one unified place.

INFER aggregates on-chain data, metadata, and contextual signals, then uses AI to turn raw blockchain information into something understandable, searchable, and explorable.

## What is INFER?

Crypto data is fragmented across explorers, docs, dashboards, and social feeds.  
INFER brings it together.

INFER acts as a living knowledge layer for crypto assets by:
- Indexing tokens and contracts across chains
- Extracting and normalizing on-chain metadata
- Adding AI-assisted explanations and summaries
- Making research faster, clearer, and more accessible

Think of INFER as **Wikipedia + block explorer + AI analyst**.

## Project Philosophy

INFER is built on three principles:

1. **Clarity over noise**  
   Data should explain itself.

2. **Open knowledge**  
   On-chain data belongs to everyone.

3. **AI as a guide, not a gatekeeper**  
   AI assists understanding, not replaces jud
